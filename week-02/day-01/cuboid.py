# Write a program that stores 3 sides of a cuboid as variables (doubles)
# The program should write the surface area and volume of the cuboid like:
# 
# Surface Area: 600
# Volume: 1000
a = 10
print ("The surface area: " + str(6 * a**2) + " m2")
print ("The volume of the cube: " + str(a**3) + " m3")
